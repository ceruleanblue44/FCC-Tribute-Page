		 <p> Mice have lived alongside humans for an estimated 15,000 years, and are
		 often used as a simple and fast-growing analogue to the human body for
		 studies on everything from cancer to the effects of space travel. Though
		 some researchers have recently raised
			questions about the accuracy of this human-mouse comparisons, these tiny
			creatures remain one of the go-to animals for biomedical researchers
			around the world. And the statue was raised in honor of this (sometimes
			maligned) relationship.</p><p>"It combines both the image of a laboratory
			mouse and a scientist, because they are connected to each other and serve
			one cause," sculptor Andrei Kharkevich told Sib.fm about his design. "The
			mouse is imprinted at the time of scientific discovery."</p><p> The statue
			stands on the grounds of Novosibirsk's Institute of Cytology and Genetics,
			the Russian magazine Sib.fm reported upon its unveiling, and was designed
			to honor the important role mice have played in scienceâ€”from studying
			disease to developing medications. Founded in 1957, the Institute of
			Cytology and Genetics was the first arm of the Russian Academy of Sciences
			devoted to the study of genetics, established just four years after the
			discovery of DNA by British scientists James Watson and Francis Crick.</p>
